Use the code in folder closedcurve as a starting point. 

Add a new class Rectangle having instance variables width and length of type double. 
Rectangle should inherit from ClosedCurve. Implement the computeArea method, as appropriate. 
Modify the Test class so that the area of Rectangle instance is also computed. 

Use the version of the Triangle class that accepts in its constructor three sides instead of a base and height.
(The code provided for this exercise has an implementation of this kind.)
