A university department consists of professors and secretaries. Each professor and each secretary has a name, a salary,
and a hire date. Use inheritance and polymorphism to create an application that represents the department and its professors
and secretaries as objects, and provides a test class that creates 3 professors and 2 secretaries, and then outputs the combined 
total of all of their salaries.
